          <h1>Elissa Willms</h1>
          <h2>Web and Graphic Designer</h2>

          <p>Elissa's journey into the design world began long before she embarked on her post-secondary education at North Island College in 2022. At 15, she embarked on a creative venture that would shape her artistic path. Together with her mother, Heather Willms, Elissa co-founded Hopscotch Quilt Shop in Southern Alberta. Their collaborative efforts led to the creation of unique quilt patterns, with each of them infusing their distinct colour schemes and styles. This creative partnership resulted in publishing six quilt books and developing an extensive pattern line. In 2011, they decided to sell the shop, but their passion for creative expression continued to flourish, expanding into paint and mixed media.</p>
          <p>As a Mixed Media Artist with a strong textile design foundation, Elissa has an unwavering passion for bookmaking and print and pattern design. Her artistic journey has been showcased in exhibitions across various locations, including Lethbridge, AB, Calgary, AB, and Cumberland, BC. These exhibitions have featured her acrylic paintings, deconstructed quilts, hand-painted lightbulb installations, and a mesmerizing solo show delved into the intricate world of handmade ink and dyes crafted from natural materials.</p>
          <p>Elissa's creative spirit is complemented by her innate organizational skills and penchant for planning. She thrives on taking on new projects and devising innovative strategies to conquer challenges, often adding her unique touch to the solutions. She is currently enrolled in the Communication Design Diploma program at NIC and is poised to graduate in the spring of 2024. Post-graduation, her aspirations lead her into Front End Development, with a clear trajectory toward venturing into the exciting UI/UX Design field as she accumulates valuable industry experience. Elissa's journey is one of continuous creative evolution, driven by her unwavering passion and dedication to the design world.</p>
