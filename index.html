            <h1>Elissa Willms</h1>
            <h2>Web and Graphic Designer</h2>

            <p>Elissa's journey into the design world began long before she embarked on her post-secondary education at North Island College in 2022. At 15, she embarked on a creative venture that would shape her artistic path. Together with her mother, Heather Willms, Elissa co-founded Hopscotch Quilt Shop in Southern Alberta. Their collaborative efforts led to the creation of unique quilt patterns, with each of them infusing their distinct colour schemes and styles. This creative partnership resulted in publishing six quilt books and developing an extensive pattern line. In 2011, they decided to sell the shop, but their passion for creative expression continued to flourish, expanding into paint and mixed media.</p>
            <p>As a Mixed Media Artist with a strong textile design foundation, Elissa has an unwavering passion for bookmaking and print and pattern design. Her artistic journey has been showcased in exhibitions across various locations, including Lethbridge, AB, Calgary, AB, and Cumberland, BC. These exhibitions have featured her acrylic paintings, deconstructed quilts, hand-painted lightbulb installations, and a mesmerizing solo show delved into the intricate world of handmade ink and dyes crafted from natural materials.</p>
            <p>Elissa's creative spirit is complemented by her innate organizational skills and penchant for planning. She thrives on taking on new projects and devising innovative strategies to conquer challenges, often adding her unique touch to the solutions. She is currently enrolled in the Communication Design Diploma program at NIC and is poised to graduate in the spring of 2024. Post-graduation, her aspirations lead her into Front End Development, with a clear trajectory toward venturing into the exciting UI/UX Design field as she accumulates valuable industry experience. Elissa's journey is one of continuous creative evolution, driven by her unwavering passion and dedication to the design world.</p>

            <h3>UI UX Class Project - Remind Me</h3>
            <p>In this project, Elissa developed the "Remind Me" app designed to aid families in managing household tasks. The project encompassed various development stages, including conducting competitive analysis and research to create user personas.</p>
            <p>A significant aspect of the project involved extensive user testing, which yielded valuable feedback from peers and the instructor. Elissa initiated the process by crafting paper prototypes for the app's screens, revealing diverse perspectives on app functionality and layout. This experience highlighted her ability to navigate new screens effectively.
            </p>
            <p>Following the initial testing round, Elissa refined the app's design through high-fidelity wireframes, incorporating feedback received during the testing phase. This iterative approach allowed her to draw insights from her own project and from evaluating other students' apps. Consistent comments and suggestions from multiple sources played a pivotal role in shaping the final product.
            </p>
            <p>Ultimately, Elissa produced functional mock-ups of the "Remind Me" app using Adobe XD, marking the successful completion of the project.</p>

            <h3>WordPress Web Design</h3>
            <p>In this web development project, Elissa harnessed the power of Elementor to craft a dynamic and informative website tailored to the unique needs of her mother, Heather Willms, a Reading Coach Specialist. Heather required a comprehensive online platform to showcase her expertise, primarily focusing on her recently published book and to provide a convenient means for interested individuals to inquire about her workshops. The resulting website, a multi-page portfolio-style platform, is a testament to Elissa's branding and design prowess.

            <h3>Magazine Cover and Spread</h3>
            <p>Elissa embarked on a captivating design journey with Adobe InDesign, crafting a magazine that drew inspiration from her book club and exuded an enchanting dark academia vibe. This project encompassed several critical components, each meticulously designed to immerse readers in literature and academia.</p>
            <p>At the heart of this endeavour was a magazine cover adorned with a custom-made title header resembling hexagonal tiles, instantly captivating the eye and setting the thematic tone. The project showcased Elissa's expertise in Adobe InDesign, where she mastered layout design, spacing, and typography to elevate a simple article into a visually engaging narrative. Her meticulous attention to detail and commitment to delivering a rich reading experience were evident throughout the magazine's creation. This project is a testament to Elissa's creative evolution and her dedication to crafting visually captivating and thematically resonant publications.</p>

            <h3>MOMA Poster</h3>
            <p>In this project, Elissa envisioned a poster for a fictional exhibition featuring the works of Mies van der Rohe during his tenure in America from 1938 to 1967, destined for display at the prestigious Museum of Modern Art. Elissa's creative journey materialized through two distinctive collage pieces, meticulously crafted using elements from Rohe's drawings, his handwriting, and textures inspired by the materials that defined his iconic architectural creations, such as marble and wood.
            </p>
            <p>Through a digital alchemy of collage construction, Elissa carefully selected and cut sections from her compositions, strategically positioning them within the architectural framework of one of Mies van der Rohe's iconic Lake Shore Drive towers. The prominent green hues that permeate the collage were a deliberate homage to the rich marble utilized in Rohe's architectural marvels, infusing the project with a tactile connection to the essence of his work. Elissa's artistry transformed this project into a visual homage to the architectural legacy of Mies van der Rohe's American journey, offering viewers a unique and immersive perspective on his timeless contributions to modern design.</p>
